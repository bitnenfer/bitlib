BIT library
===========

This a small library that compiles several useful code I've used in previous projects.

Convetions
---------

- Abstract classes must start with an I prefix and written in PascalCase.
- Global functions are written in PascalCase.
- Global variables must be prefixed with a G and written in PascalCase.
- Constant variables must be written in upper case SNAKE_CASE. If possible set as constexpr (constexpr).
- Member Functions and Data Members are written in PascalCase.
- Boolean variables must start with a b prefix.
- Files must be written in snake_case. For ex: hash_table.cpp / hash_table.h
- Special typedefs must be written in PascalCase and with a \_t sufix.
- More to come.. ?
